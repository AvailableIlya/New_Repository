Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
"It's all about makin' that GTA"
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
Yo, man
Yo, man
Yo, yo, yo man
Yo, man
Yo, man
Get the fuck out
Pump that
Pump that
Pump, p-pump, p-pump that
Pump that
Pump that bass
Motherfucker, say what?
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded twelve-gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
